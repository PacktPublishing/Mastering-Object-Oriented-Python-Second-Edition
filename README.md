**Build powerful applications with reusable code using OOP design patterns and Python 3.7**

## What is this book about?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a relatively complex discipline to master, and it can be difficult to see how general principles apply to each language's unique features. With the help of the latest edition of Mastering Objected-Oriented Python, you'll be shown how to effectively implement OOP in Python, and even explore Python 3.x. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore a variety of different design patterns for the __init__() method 
* Learn to use Flask to build a RESTful web service 
* Discover SOLID design patterns and principles 
* Use the features of Python 3's abstract base 
* Create classes for your own applications 
* Design testable code using pytest and fixtures 
* Understand how to design context managers that leverage the 'with' statement 
* Create a new type of collection using standard library and design techniques 
* Develop new number types above and beyond the built-in classes of numbers

def F(n: int) -> int:
if n in (0, 1):
return 1
else:
return F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```
